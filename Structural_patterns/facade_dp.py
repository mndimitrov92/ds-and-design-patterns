Facade design pattern

INTENT:
    Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework,
     or any other complex set of classes.
APPLICABILITY:
    *Use the Facade pattern when you need to have a limited but straightforward interface to a complex subsystem.
    *Use the Facade when you want to structure a subsystem into layers.
PROS AND CONS:
    PROS:
        You can isolate your code from the complexity of a subsystem.
    CONS:
        A facade can become a god object coupled to all classes of an app.
USAGE:
    The Facade pattern is commonly used in apps written in Python. Itâ€™s especially handy when working with complex libraries and APIs.
IDENTIFICATION:
    Facade can be recognized in a class that has a simple interface, but delegates most of the work to other classes.
    Usually, facades manage full life cycle of objects they use.
